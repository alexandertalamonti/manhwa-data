The demon gives them an elixir of immortality and the method of ending their existence by ""devouring"" one another. Soon after, one among them begins to devour his companions. Realizing the danger posed by staying together, they scatter across the globe.

Centuries later in 1930's America, a certain federal investigator tries his best to combat the rise of organized crime during Prohibition, send a particularly infuriating terrorist to Alcatraz, and catch an outrageous thief duo. Meanwhile, the transcontinental train, the Flying Pussyfoot, begins its trail of blood across the country.

In 2002, a small group of the original Advenna Avis alchemists are on a journey to find the rest of their fellow immortals. However, there is one companion they did not expect to meet again.

Seemingly unrelated events, from a sleepy Italian city in the early 1700's to a modern luxury cruise ship traveling across the Pacific, reveal themselves to be far more connected than anyone could imagine...

Noticing his poverty, an old shop owner directs him to a store that supposedly purchases lifespan, time, and health. While not completely believing the man's words, Kusunoki nevertheless finds himself at the address out of desperation and curiosity.

Kusunoki is crushed when he finds out the true monetary value of his lifespan—totaling a meager three hundred thousand yen. Deciding to sell the next 30 years of his life for ten thousand yen per year, Kusunoki is left with only three months to live. After heading home with the money, he is greeted by an unexpected visitor: the same store clerk he sold his lifespan to. She introduces herself as Miyagi, the one tasked with the job of observing him until the last three days of his life.

Jumyou wo Kaitotte Moratta. Ichinen ni Tsuki, Ichimanen de. follows the remaining three months of Kusunoki's life as he confronts lingering regrets from the past and discovers what truly gives life value.

Among the few elites to have gone professional as a middle school student, he is considered a genius. But what lies behind his prodigious facade is a teenage boy who suffers immense pressure from both his family and from the high expectations from the shogi community. Rei moves out to live a more independent life away from his family, but his unorganized lifestyle and unsociable personality show no signs of improvement.

However, in a twist of fate that will prove to be a turning point in his life, Rei encounters the Kawamoto sisters—the motherly Akari, the passionate Hinata, and the energetic Momo—who take great care of him. 3-gatsu no Lion tells the story of Rei as he reshapes his melancholic life and picks up the courage to begin facing the problems he evaded during his past.

Yet, when strange purple orbs rain down from the sky one day, the students find their lives changing beyond the limits of imagination.

Capable of sporadic and sudden destruction, these spheres quickly send the world into a panic. With the South Korean military forces stretched thin, the government hastily enlists those in secondary education and above into the army. Now drafted into military training, Class 3-2 must abruptly set down their pens and pick up rifles instead.

Promised that they will encounter little danger—and that bonus university points await them post-service—the reluctant students are coaxed into accepting their new duty. Marching onward with an apathetic and easygoing attitude, the class begins their military service, unaware of the grim reality that will soon erode their innocent, carefree spirits.

However, while walking his dog one night, the reality of his hopeless situation settles in and he breaks into sobs in a park. But that sadness is short-lived, as an encounter with an extraterrestrial object leaves him with a healthy yet mechanical body. Unsettled by the foreign body and his inability to cry anymore, Inuyashiki starts to believe he has lost his humanity.

However, one night, he saves a homeless man from death, and the sight of the happy and grateful man moves him to tears—proving to him that he is still a human. From that moment onward, Inuyashiki resolves to put his new power to use for the purpose of saving those in need.

Unfortunately, his joy does not last for long, for he finds that there is a new threat determined to revel in its own newfound power through horrifying means. Thus, Inuyashiki's mission turns from being a small-time neighborhood hero to a guardian against a thriving monster.

Rejected for being a ""tomboyish girl"" and a transgender boy, he cannot confide in anyone and suffers in the prison of his own skin. Subtly, he expresses his genuine self through a buzzcut and secret purchases of boys' clothes.

However, Ryou's life changes when Jin Satou joins his class. Jin is laidback, fearless, and straightforward. He is not ashamed of his interests, nor does he care about others' opinions. For the first time ever, instead of envy, Ryou feels admiration. After running into Ryou in a men's fashion store, Jin proposes the unexpected: they should start a clothing brand together.

Overwhelmed and afraid, Ryou confesses everything to Jin. To his surprise, Jin is fully accepting. Honored to have his first genuine friend and a trusting partner, Ryou agrees to set their business in motion. Recruiting a photographer and collaborating with talented outcasts, the boys prepare to express themselves through fashion and change the world—one step at a time.

She has forsaken things that would make others her age happy: friends, marriage, and motherhood. Her greatest wish is to debut successfully as a fighter in the featherweight division, proving that all her past sacrifices have been worthwhile.

Out of the seven, Lucky is the only one who lacks his siblings' talent, earning the ire of his equally talented pianist father, Gakuon. Publicly, the Otogami siblings are known as sextuplets due to Lucky's ostracization from the family following their parents' divorce. Because of his mother's subsequent hospitalization, Lucky now lives with his abusive aunt who treats him like a housekeeper. Despite the suffering he has endured, Lucky still loves the piano and plays it whenever he visits his mother in the hospital.

One day, he is surprised to find his mother awake and off her medication. She laments that she was unable to give birth to Lucky as a genius, which saddens him—he does not blame anyone but himself for being a failure. When he seeks her guidance, his mother encourages Lucky to prove to his father that the talentless can also play the piano. This inspires him to take the entrance exam for the prestigious Shibuya Music High School, where his unique, albeit mediocre, playstyle catches the attention of Hideo Dada—his father's former teacher.

After his admission, Lucky finds himself being tutored by Dada alongside a reluctant Ako Furusu—the class representative yearning for vengeance against Gakuon for pushing her pianist mother out of the spotlight.

From elementary to middle school, he was constantly bullied by his peers. He has now entered high school, and yet this has not changed. One day, the school's top delinquent, Kanade Toramaru, calls him out, and she immediately declares ownership over him.

His high school days will now be full of fear, as he spends them as Kanade's personal errand boy. However, one big misunderstanding between Fuyuhiko and Kanade remains: Kanade believes that the two of them are dating. Her confession of love is misinterpreted by him, leaving her blissfully unaware of Fuyuhiko's dread for her.

While this misunderstanding stays neglected, Fuyuhiko and Kanade become ever closer, slowly pushing this imaginary romance on the verge of turning into a real one.

Ren, the student council president at her school, speaks harshly to her subordinates for the sake of performing her job efficiently. The grim reaper, however, can read her mind and knows that, in her head, Ren secretly has many kind things to say. After a first encounter, he possesses Ren and forces her to vocalize her inner thoughts, so that others will know how much their student council president actually cares for them before it is too late. When she realizes that she is not in control of her own speech, he leaves her body and formally reintroduces himself. Since he has no name to go with his title, Ren calls him Ai.

Ren threatens him with a weapon for violating her privacy, but rather than flinch away, Ai welcomes her to try killing him. He reveals that not only is his job boring, but it also reinforces his loneliness; after all, no one is happy to receive a visit from a grim reaper. Out of compassion, Ren promises to always stay by Ai's side and be the person he can talk to, though she does not understand that his presence means her death is imminent.

When the boy's older brother shows up, Yutaka is introduced to Tane and Minoru Ueda—a pair of siblings with a significant age gap.

When Yutaka meets the brothers again, they ask to learn how to make his special rice balls; little Tane insists that they were the best he had ever eaten. Succumbing to Tane's adorable pleas and his own fear of the intimidating Minoru, Yutaka agrees to become their cooking teacher.

As lessons morph into meals, Yutaka and the siblings grow closer—but Tane and Minoru's close bond draws out uncomfortable memories for Yutaka, and there are feelings lurking beneath the surface of these group meals that were not initially apparent.

Unfortunately, finding her knight in shining armor is a little difficult at an all-girls school. The closest thing to a dreamy stud is the school idol, Nagisa Fujiwara, whose stunning and boyish appearance captivates many of her underclassmen.

While applying makeup in the bathroom, Miu hears a scream and something crash. Rushing to see what happened, she finds Fujiwara standing above the shattered remains of a vase. Desperate to keep her slip-up under wraps, Fujiwara drags Miu to the back of the school and begs her to keep the incident a secret, willing to do anything in return. Seeing an opportunity, Miu requests that they begin dating as preparation for the day she meets her fated lover. But as the schoolgirls' tale of comedy and romance unfolds, the princess realizes that her prince might be closer than she once thought.

She is currently dating her dead sister's fiancé, Tougo. Although Haru and Tougo were only to have an arranged marriage of convenience, Natsumi knew that her sister's feelings toward him were utterly genuine. Despite this, when Tougo asked Natsumi if she wanted to become his new girlfriend, she agreed, but on one condition: he must take her to all the places he went with Haru.

Torn with shame, Natsumi meets him every week, seeing the places he visited with Haru and hearing about their experiences. Parting ways after a notably painful encounter overcome with guilt, she is ready to join her sister and begins to move in front of an oncoming train—until Tougo stops her and announces that if she dies, he will too.

As the curse of spring leads to a fleeting summer, two people connected by death find solace in each other, grappling both with their own feelings and the ever-present memory of one long gone.

A proposed major software upgrade—an artificial intelligence—will give the system an unprecedented degree of independent decision-making power, but serious questions are raised in regard to how much control can safely be given to a non-human intelligence. In order to more fully assess the system, a new space-station habitat—a world in miniature—is developed for deployment of the fully operational system, named Spartacus. This mini-world can then be ""attacked"" in a series of escalating tests to assess the system's responses and capabilities. If Spartacus gets out of hand, the system can be shut down and the station destroyed...unless Spartacus decides to take matters into its own hands and take the fight to Earth.

This is how it has always been, and it is no different for Kasane Fuchi's late mother, Sukeyo—a famous stage actress whose charming image and acting prowess have captivated the world.

Kasane aspires to be an actress like Sukeyo once was. Yet, although she possesses incredible acting abilities, Kasane looks nothing like her mother. In fact, her visage leads many people to wonder if the two are even related. Due to her appearance, Kasane is bullied and ostracized by her peers at school. This makes her dream seemingly impossible to achieve, where good looks are assets in the acting industry.

However, Kasane's life takes a turn for the better when she remembers her mother's words—to wear her lipstick and kiss whoever she desires. Much to Kasane's astonishment, the first person she kisses while wearing the lipstick causes her to temporarily switch faces with them. Now given a chance to pursue her ambitions, to what lengths will Kasane use this newfound power?

From her radiant smile when she is with her family to the times when sickness ravages her body in the hospital, he records hours upon hours of footage. After her passing, Yuuta compiles her life into a movie to screen at his school, deciding to add a bit of fantasy to the ending of his film, Dead Explosion Mother, with a literal explosion!

Following the backlash caused by his supposedly tone-deaf portrayal of his mother's death, Yuuta trudges to the hospital roof to take his own life—but there, he meets a girl named Eri. Captivated by his film, Eri requests Yuuta to make a new  one that will blow the previous out of the water and prove his critics wrong. The movie they set out to make will stand apart by blurring the line between fact and fiction. And of course, it wouldn't be a Yuuta film if it didn't have his personal flavor—just a dash of fantasy.

As they reminisce about the past, Tsugumi is shocked to find out Ayukawa has been disabled following an accident. Unable to walk on his own, he now has to rely on the use of a wheelchair.

However, as she begins to interact with him more and learns about his condition, Tsugumi realizes her feelings for him may not have disappeared entirely.

The main character is Kabu, a little peddler and heavy addicted. Used to any kind of hallucinogenic trip, he is able to feel
the happiness through the ecstasy of the drug, while on the same time hypocritically hating those who gave birth to that society which has forced him to the excess. After an overdose caused by mixing two incompatible drugs, he spends his days looking for stimulants until he encounters an enigmatic man who offers him a new kind of illegal substance: Ultra Heaven. From that moment his incredible journey begins, where dream and reality are fused in an undivided world, causing him hysterical or joyful reactions and unrestrained pains.

But what really is Ultra Heaven and who's really behind it? And who is the guru who is promoting the meditation as a powerful way to influence the whole universe surrounding us? With the help of a special amplifier helmet, Kabu starts a trip into the deep and hidden layers of his conscience, diving into a nightmare he would never discover...

A microchip is implanted that is set to detonate if 042 becomes angry (and by proxy, is about to kill someone) as a safeguard. He is then made the janitor of a co-ed high school, under constant supervision by a team of scientists led by Dr. Shiina.

What follows is a rollercoaster of events that depicts 042's struggles to fit into a society which has made it clear from the outset that he is not welcome. Along the way, he manages to touch a set of lives who will be forever changed by the encounter, and in turn he will be touched and changed by those who gather around him.

With a combination of sparse line work and visual codes borrowed from animation and film, the quiet melancholy lives of a young couple struggling to make ends meet are beautifully captured in this poetic masterpiece.

Uninvolved with the political movements of the time, Ichirou and Sachiko hope for something better, but they're no revolutionaries; their spare time is spent drinking, smoking, daydreaming, and sleeping—together and at times with others. While Ichirou attempts to make a living from his comics, Sachiko's parents are eager to arrange a marriage for her, but Ichirou doesn't seem interested. Both in their relationship and at work, Ichirou and Sachiko are unable to say the things they need to say, and like any couple, at times say things to each other that they do not mean, ultimately communicating as much with their body language and what remains unsaid as with words.

But when Shion breaks the town's sacred rules and sneaks into a sealed shrine during the festival, dragging Keiichi along with her, things take a turn for the worse. Now, Keiichi and Shion find themselves in fear of being spirited away due to their mistake and must find a way to atone before it is too late.

However, the tides of the battle unexpectedly turn with the arrival of Jeanne d'Arc: a young maiden who not only wields immense power but also possesses the ability to hear the voice of the angel. Proving her prowess on the battlefield, Jeanne is soon hailed as a miracle, reinvigorating and rallying the French to continue their uphill campaign.

While she leads the crusade to liberate France from its English invaders, Jeanne gradually adjusts to her new role as a magical girl with the help of her close confidant, Riz Hawkwood. Their unique abilities enable them to boldly fight a two-front war against ""witches"" and other magical girls with sinister intentions. But as the beacon of light from Jeanne's cause grows ever stronger, so does the darkness that lurks behind the theater of war.

The story begins during an exchange of ghost stories between Mai and her friends, who are interrupted twice: first by a mysterious ""male student"" and then by a fellow classmate, who warns them of how their ghost stories attract spirits.
While out walking, Mai sees the building that all the ghost stories surround and decides to go in. As she is about to touch a camera she found in the middle of the room, a man stops her and ends up injuring himself. Mai is then forced to work as a stand-in assistant for the man, an employee of the ""male student,"" who was hired to study the ""paranormal"" events occurring at the school. Mai nicknames this ""student"" ""Naru"" for his narcissistic attitude. Naru owns a paranormal investigation company SPR and Mai eventually earns a part-time job at SPR after assisting with the first case. The more involved Mai becomes with Naru, the more she learns about herself and her feelings towards him.

Along with Shibuya's assistant, Lin, the SPR also finds itself assisted by various spirit mediums and exorcists.

From this, the rumored ghost of the club came to life.

Grumpy insomniac Ganta Nakami stumbles across the moderately rebellious yet easygoing Isaki Magari in the Astronomy Club's abandoned observatory. Magari is jolted awake and tries to escape from the scene, only to have a broken door prevent that, forcing the two inside. The two forge an unlikely friendship, leading them to use the observatory as a safe space for them to interact.

Kimi wa Houkago Insomnia follows the insomniacs Nakami and Magari's time in the starlit observatory as they help each other cope with insomnia and the lasting effects it has on student life.

Instead, he is going straight to the unrivaled master of rakugo—a form of comedic Japanese storytelling—Yakumo Yuurakutei himself. Due to a series of events, Yotarou becomes enamored with rakugo, bent on becoming a shunichi. Yakumo, who never takes apprentices, almost immediately agrees to pass his trade on to Yotarou. Together with Konatsu, a young lady living in the household, they start struggling toward becoming the new hope for rakugo, which seems to be slowly withering away alongside the Shouwa era.

However, as Yotarou gets to know his new mentor and ""big sis,"" he notices hints of a dark past in both of them. The environment of the household becomes strained and, at times, scary. Naturally, no hardships matter to the young Yotarou, as his gaze is set upon their mutual future—the future where he becomes the master of rakugo.

According to local superstition, those who leave Okinomiya or the nearby village of Hinamizawa will be cursed by the god Oyashiro. However, everything has been peaceful and quiet since they moved—that is, until gas suddenly erupts from the swamp near Hinamizawa, killing thousands of people.

Mion will become the next heir of the Sonozaki family, and Shion will attend St. Lucia Academy, away from her dear sister and their relatives. But Shion escapes the school and returns to Hinamizawa, unaware of the cruel tragedy awaiting her.

When she reunites with her sister and gets a part-time job—while pretending to be Mion—she meets Satoshi Houjou, a boy her age with whom she falls madly in love. But when she learns about Satoshi's horrible family situation, she begins to resent everyone in his household—even his younger sister, Satoko. When tensions escalate and Satoshi abruptly goes missing, Shion begins to suspect that her own family may have had something to do with his disappearance.

A year later, Shion meets Keiichi Maebara, Mion's crush. Her sister's infatuation with Keiichi stirs up her old feelings for Satoshi, and awakens a vicious desire to find out the truth behind his disappearance once and for all. However, Shion's quest for the truth will send her spiraling down a dark path of madness and despair.

Fortunately, it seems he's on the right path, ranking first in the nation's mock exams and set to enter his high school of choice. 

However, everything changes in a single night when he notices a girl across the street on his way home. Enraptured by her overwhelming cuteness, it's love at first sight for Nasa. But in his infatuated daze, he fails to notice the approaching danger speeding down the road and finds himself at death's door. Barely alive thanks to the girl's intervention, Nasa musters the courage to confess his love to her, fearing she might otherwise vanish from his life. She accepts his proposal on one condition: marriage, to which Nasa gladly accepts before passing out from his injuries. Upon waking, however, the girl is nowhere to be found.

After recovering from his injuries, Nasa tosses his previous ambitions aside and dedicates his life to finding the girl that captured his heart, yet several years pass to no avail. But one night, when an unexpected visitor comes knocking on his door, Nasa finds himself facing a woman that would forever change his world: his wife.

Slavery has been abolished and African Americans are able to live freely. Yet, tensions still run high in the country—they are shunned by the majority of the white population and ruthlessly killed by the vicious Ku Klux Klan. Amidst this era of uncertainty, former heavyweight boxer Victor Freeman contends with prejudice while evading the law and bounty hunters looking to collect the high price on his head. Though charged with the murders of several white folk, the truth driving Victor's actions is much more horrific than any truly realize.

Hiding among the human race are intelligent, man-eating demons, who have assimilated themselves into positions of power and taken advantage of mankind's bigotry to fill their bellies. Having witnessed his father being brutally devoured by demons as a child, Victor vows to eradicate their kind for good. However, slaying them leaves nothing but a human corpse behind, effectively casting him as a cold-hearted killer. Regardless, with his robust arsenal and unparalleled boxing prowess, Victor soldiers on to destroy demonkind—even if doing so will turn the world against him.

That is the service Kaoru Ushijima, the ""loan shark,"" offers.

In a society in which he believes one cannot live without either taking advantage of or being taken advantage of, Ushijima strives to be the former, operating in the black market and issuing loans to those he knows cannot afford the principal, let alone the mounting interest. However, he intends to have every yen he gives out to be paid back in full.

Ever since she could remember, Akane Ousaki has been mesmerized by her father Tooru's rakugo performances. Peeking in behind a sliding door, she would spend hours watching and mimicking his work.

For Tooru, the only thing separating him from that coveted rank is a promotion test in front of an audience and a senior rakugo master, Issho Arakawa. Despite his passionate performance, Tooru finds himself expelled from the rakugo school following the exam. This makes him give up on rakugo entirely and settle for a regular job, breaking his daughter's heart.

Filled with grief and anger, Akane now seeks vengeance on the man who refuses to see the genius behind her father's rakugo style. She begs Tooru's former rakugo master, Shiguma Arakawa, to take her under his wing. But Shiguma feels unworthy of taking on another pupil after what happened to her father six years prior. In order to see if she has what it takes to enter the rakugo world, Shiguma urges Akane to test her resolve by performing in front of an audience.

However, three months later, Miyano realizes that Sasaki is more bothersome than admirable. At school, Miyano is greeted by him with playful teases, not to mention the frequent friendly skinship he receives. When Sasaki asks for manga recommendations, Miyano lets him borrow a boys-love comic he owns. Surprisingly, Sasaki ended up enjoying its content and got hooked on boys-love as well, marking the start of a shared passion. Could it develop into something more?

However, when the loud and boisterous Taichi Sagawa comes into his life, Kouhei discovers that Taichi's voice alone shines as bright as the sun. Easily misunderstood by most people, Taichi is taken aback when Kouhei notices his good-natured personality. Taichi's valiant personality urges Kouhei to demand more for himself, pushing him into the lively world that he had always yearned to live in. Through this, Taichi helps Kouhei find a community of people who are willing to listen and understand, though they might have to repeat themselves more than once. Through the ups and downs of living in two very different worlds, Taichi and Kouhei find a connection that transcends all barriers and runs deeper than just a regular friendship.

Hidamari ga Kikoeru is a touching story about loneliness, self-respect, and finding a bond through the commonalities that we all share as people.

Days fly by, and Tomoya enters his second year of high school having made no progress on his game. On top of that, he is shocked to discover that the girl he met is his unremarkable classmate, Megumi Katou. Determined to make his game a reality, Tomoya ropes Megumi into the project and sets out to convince his childhood friend Eriri Spencer Sawamura and upperclassman Utaha Kasumigaoka to help with its development. Tomoya soon finds out, however, that working with friends on such an ambitious project is much more difficult than he initially thought.

The next day after being bullied and only to be saved yet again, he asks the studio to teach him dancing in hopes of changing his image. Now entering a bright and fast-paced new world, Tatara dedicates his time to dancing as he sweeps over the dance hall.

To that end, she has gone so far as to map out her entire life ahead of time, but all of her preparation flies out the window on the first day of school.

Mitsumi misses her train stop and is about to be late to the entrance ceremony, which is especially troublesome because she is supposed to give a speech as the new students' representative. While lamenting her situation, Sousuke Shima—a handsome first-year student who is also late—sees her and offers to walk with her  to school. They eventually make it to school, although Mitsumi has some unfortunate accidents soon after that leave a less-than-favorable impression on everyone. In spite of her misfortune, her classmates soon take notice of Mitsumi and Sousuke's chemistry, despite their differing personas.

With the new year already off to an interesting start, Mitsumi is eager to get to know her classmates better and get involved at her school. Only time will tell if this country bumpkin can make it in the city, but one thing has become certain: she definitely will not be alone on her journey!

But darkness is forming in Rena's heart, and even her closest friends may not be safe from it.

Rena's divorced father has recently found a new girlfriend, a sleazy woman named Rina Mamiya. Rena's hatred of her is solidified when she discovers that the woman and her true boyfriend are trying to swindle Rena's father out of his money. After a tumultuous confrontation with Rina about what she has learned, Rena realizes that she must resort to desperate measures to keep her father safe. When her friends notice that she is acting rather strange, they investigate what she has done, but instead of abandoning her as Rena assumed they would, they band together to support and help her.

However, when she discovers a shocking snag in her plans, Rena realizes that she may have trusted the wrong people, and begins to become highly suspicious of her friends and the other townspeople. And as she uncovers the truth about the town's long history of murders and disappearances, she realizes that only drastic actions can save the village from utter destruction.

Each of the eight stories in the collection is lifted from the Edo-era Japanese storytelling form. As Tatsumi notes in the afterword, the world of rakugo, filled with mystery, emotion, revenge, hope, and, of course, love, overlaps perfectly with the world of Gekiga that he has spent the better part of his life developing.

These slice-of-life stories resonate with modern readers thanks to their comedic elements and familiarity with human idiosyncrasies. In one, a father finds his son too bookish and arranges for two workers to take the young man to a brothel on the pretext of visiting a new shrine. In another particularly beloved rakugo tale, a married man falls in love with a prostitute. When his wife finds out, she is enraged and sets a curse on the other woman. The prostitute responds by cursing the wife, and the two escalate in a spiral of voodoo doll cursing. Soon both are dead, but even death can’t extinguish their jealousy.

Tatsumi’s love of wordplay shines through in the telling of these whimsical stories, and yet he still offers timeless insight into human nature.

In contrast stands Asako Yaeshima, a worker formerly nicknamed ""Aseko""—""ase"" meaning sweat—due to her unusual problem of excessive perspiration.

To deal with her crisis, Asako develops a morning routine: she mixes different scents of Liliadrop soaps and unscented deodorants to mask her body odor. But her effort does not fool Koutarou Natori, a genius fragrance developer at the company with a sensitive and infallible sense of smell.

Koutarou, astounded by Asako's natural smell combined with the soap, insists on sniffing her every day for a week to save their company's reputation by creating new Asako-inspired fragrances. With such an important reason at stake, Asako consents but never imagines how close she and Koutarou would soon become.

However, she is far from having the motivation or skills to realize these hopes. When a friend introduces her to an unorthodox, backstreet art class taught by the strong-armed Kenzou Hidaka, called simply as ""sensei,"" Akiko decides to enroll, expecting an easy ride and an automatic improvement in her art skills. To her chagrin, what she gets is something else entirely—a tough, demanding, and uncompromising teacher with absolutely no interest in manga.

But when Akiko takes up Sensei's challenge of an intense schedule, she comes to recognize how much he cares about his students and forms a close bond with him. With Sensei's guidance, Akiko learns what is necessary to become a successful mangaka as well as what it means to be an adult.

One day, Haruo meets his match in fellow classmate Akira Oono. Akira is not the type of person to frequent an arcade: she has perfect grades, is well-loved, and comes from a wealthy background. Even so, not only is she able to score a 29-game win streak, but she also manages to beat Haruo seven times in a row. Eager to end her domination, Haruo duels Akira in Street Fighter 2 and resorts to underhanded tactics—which earns him a slap in the face from the shy girl. This encounter starts a strange and rocky relationship between the two rival gamers.

Standing where no man has ever set foot before, there is an exhilarating feeling of success. This is what Mori Buntarou trains, works, and lives for.

His climb to the top starts when he transfers to a new high school. Despite his lonesome and solitary nature, Mori's classmates persuade him to climb the school building. Without a harness or hesitation, he begins his scale to reach the top. Edging past the point of no return, he halts when he is faced with a final intimidating obstacle—a horizontal overhang.

While searching for high-paying work, he comes across a job posting for the SS Agency, offering a salary that exactly matches the monthly one million yen needed for Shouta's treatment.

In the bureau located at Desperado, a second-hand bookstore, Raizou meets his new employer Kinume. Although she discloses little about his upcoming duties, his desperation for money brings him to accept the job. Convinced that he would serve as a hotel housekeeper, Raizou quickly realizes that his cleaning work is starkly different when he stumbles upon a dead body—assassinated by an 11-year-old girl, Miharu Suzukaze.

Nonetheless, Raizou's successful first mission leads him to become Miharu's hitman partner. Having protected political figures his entire life, Raizou is now brought into a world of murder as the pair slowly uncover the criminal scheme unfolding behind the scenes.

When a bell rings, customers from different places of birth and races appear who ask for mysterious and delicious dishes. They are actually the same dishes served to the salarymen, but these special guests find them to be more exotic than to what they are used to.

However, Ryouko is different from the others: as a chronic amnesiac, she tends to forget events and faces, recording everything she witnesses in a notebook that can be trusted when her memory cannot be. In addition, her irritable childhood friend, the ""Super High School-Level Neurologist"" Yasuke Matsuda, works tirelessly to cure her disorder. Yasuke is the only person whom Ryouko can never forget—after all, she is deeply in love with him.

This awkward pair lead a hectic but happy life at Hope's Peak Academy—until they are confronted by a strange girl who seems to be the very embodiment of despair. As her notebook becomes increasingly unreliable and Yasuke's dark secrets are revealed, can Ryouko cling to hope, or will she give in to despair?

Magu finds himself at the mercy of this young girl as he attempts to regain his full powers—not to mention his bigger and ""badder"" form. However, as Magu progresses in his mission, his friendship with Ruru blossoms as he learns a bit more about the lowly world he plans to destroy.

The strange and ancient art of Sexy Commando (the roots of which extend back into Japan's Muromachi period) is a martial one; however, instead of focusing on how to defeat an opponent with punches, kicks, or grappling, it focuses on how to distract the opponent. The logic follows that any distracted opponent is unable to fight, and therefore the art of Sexy Commando trumps any other form of martial arts. There are as many techniques as there are ways to distract, though Wakame High School's Sexy Command Club tends to employ the unzipping of the trousers (Elize no Yuutsu).

After seeing her undress, feelings of affection begin to blossom within Kanba, despite Fujiyama being considered unattractive by both peers and passersby. Kanba asks her out on an impulse and—to his surprise—she says yes.

Through school events, fireworks festivals, and more, Kanba juggles gawking at his new girlfriend and keeping their relationship a secret. This is no easy task for the less-than-popular Kanba, as Fujiyama often draws the eyes of all around her.

Fuijyama-san wa Shishunki follows the pair as they stumble hand-in-hand through many lighthearted, comedic situations and gradually learn more about young love and each other.

Blessed with great fortune since his childhood, he grew up wanting nothing but affection from his oftentimes distant family.

After losing his mother and crippling his dominant arm in an accident, Tamahiko fell into deep despair and was cast aside by his own father for his handicap. Condemned to live isolated in the countryside where he would not bring shame to his family's name, he resigned himself to dying alone—until one day, a young girl named Yuzuki Tachibana appeared on his doorstep, proclaiming that Tamahiko's father sent her to be his bride.

As she takes care of Tamahiko, Yuzuki brings a feeling of springtime into Tamahiko's dreary life, allowing him to gradually heal from the deep emotional scars of his youth. Their lives slowly intertwine as both Tamahiko and Yuzuki taste the fruits of their first love.

With Kankichi's help, Souichirou begins to establish a life in Edo's tenements and exchanges his longtime sword Kunifusa for a bamboo blade, due to his newfound desire to refrain from violence.

Before long, Souichirou finds himself stalked by the brutal assassin Shinnosuke Kikuchi, who delights in butchering anyone caught between him and his target. Each time Souichirou must step forward to defend himself or the people of the tenements, he reawakens the intense bloodlust of his younger days and resurrects memories he would much rather forget.

Why did such a thing happen? Why was no one able to prevent it?

In the beginning, high school boys Hiroki and his friend Takashi are rescued from bullying by a notorious gangster, Miyamoto. At first, they are thrilled to be under his protection, and cheerfully run off anyone who threatens them with the mere mention of Miyamoto's name. Soon, they learn that there is a lot more to being in Miyamoto's gang than just being protected. In return, they're expected to offer loyalty and obedience, or face possibly deadly consequences. This becomes harder as the violence and the crimes they find themselves committing begins to escalate.

One night, they kidnap a high school girl, Sachiko. Now Hiroki has two battles to face. Internally, he faces the dissonance between his sense of self-preservation and his conscience. Externally, Sachiko's twin sister Miki, who goes to Hiroki's high school, her parents and the police are searching for the missing girl. Will Sachiko ever return home? What kind of person--or monster--will Hiroki become?

Upon bearing witness to Saitama's amazing power, Genos, a cyborg, is determined to become Saitama's apprentice. During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association.

Thus, it is no surprise that the one he wants to kill the most is never far off from his mind: the class idol, Anna Yamada.

Reading alone in his beloved school library, he inadvertently begins to rendezvous with Yamada, who comes to secretly gorge on her beloved candies and sweets. Through their interactions, Ichikawa discovers just how much of a ditz Yamada is, and cannot help but support her from the sidelines. Meanwhile, Yamada herself cannot help but tease Ichikawa relentlessly due to his flustered reactions.

With an array of heartwarming daily interactions, the distant bond between the two grows into something more than just library acquaintances. Perhaps, in time, Ichikawa will come to realize that his murderous desires have turned into something else entirely.

Comprised of the somewhat idiotic Yuusuke ""Bossun"" Fujisaki, the gallant Hime ""Himeko"" Onizuka, and the silent but surprisingly popular Kazuyoshi ""Switch"" Usui, the SKET Brigade is dedicated to solving various problems on campus. However, the club rarely receives requests, so the members spend most of their time messing around with random, trivial matters. Both hilarious and heartwarming, SKET Dance is a lighthearted comedy following the daily high school lives of an odd trio of friends.

When Renge meets her classmate Sumire Yotsuya, the latter is clearly not the 16-year-old student she claims to be, but instead is a wooden puppet operated by an old man dressed in black. Though the students and faculty attempt to ward off the man, he refuses to break character and only gives confused responses from the puppet Sumire. Thanks to the principal seeing Sumire as a real girl, teachers and pupils alike must accept this new and odd student as the normal person ""she"" claims to be.

Now classmates with Sumire, Renge is creeped out when ""she"" insists they hang out and become friends, and worries how it might affect her reputation at school. However, when Renge falls into trouble, it's none other than Sumire who comes to her aid. Finding that Sumire (and the old man) aren't so bad after all, she decides to give ""her"" a shot. 

Sumire♡16-sai!! follows Renge and her schoolmates as they attend school with this masquerader and come to realize that despite the wooden body, Sumire's heart is certainly real.

Idolized for his athletic and intellectual competence, looks and wealth, Naoto lived like a king during his elementary school days—then entered Mikoto Kujou, a plain, gloomy-looking transfer student.

Due to her low financial status, Naoto was initially apathetic towards Mikoto. But despite having just arrived at his school, she completely eclipsed him in everything by consistently scoring top marks in exams and placing first in athletic events. After a brief confrontation with her that left him shocked, Naoto vowed to outdo her no matter the cost.

Ten years later, they are now students attending the same college. Having failed to defeat Mikoto throughout middle and high school, Naoto decides they will have one last game: if he can make Mikoto fall in love with him and then break her heart, it will be his victory. However, he finds himself falling in love with her instead...

From socializing to buying things in real life, the app has become indispensable in daily life, especially for second-year high school student Ataru Kashigawa. He uses Real Account as a means to escape reality and he feels a sense of belonging and connection to his followers, whom he considers as his friends.

However, Ataru's views on friendship drastically change when he gets plunged into the virtual world of Real Account and is forced to participate in horrific death games alongside ten thousand other users. But these are far from ordinary online death games as dying in the world of Real Account means that you and all your followers die in reality. To make matters worse, having no followers also means certain death. As Aratu begins to participate in these death games, he discovers the existence of Yuuma Mukai, a teenager who looks just like him. This discovery creates a twist in events.

Betrayed by his so-called friends one by one, Ataru is left with one anonymous follower. In this virtual world where a single follower could be the difference between life or death, Ataru must survive and complete these games in order to return to the real world.

After being mistaken for a boy, Haruhi is forced by Kyouya Ootori to work for the Host Club to repay her debt. Tamaki Suou, the princely leader of the club, eagerly takes her under his wing to teach her the ways of the host.

Things, however, are never quite so simple with the Host Club around. Even the most mundane events can turn into huge spectacles with the likes of prankster twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, stoic Takashi Morinozuka, and sweet Mitsukuni ""Hunny"" Haninozuka.

Tired of killing and betrayal, he wants to die. However, no method of execution works on him because as much as the seemingly apathetic Gabimaru refuses to admit it, he does have a reason to live. He wants to return to his wife, who was the reason why he softened up and failed to be an effective assassin. Thus, he refuses to die.

Asaemon the Decapitator, a famous executioner, sees this and has a proposal for the ninja. She wants Gabimaru to join an expedition to an island south of Japan in search of the elixir of life in exchange for a full pardon by the Shogunate. However, this island is not a normal island: it is believed to be Paradise.

However the island is full of mysteries, and the exploring team—consisting of those marked for death—might not be fully prepared to handle them.

Even more so when the spotlight only shines on professional heroes, those legally authorized to use their special powers known as Quirks in public for the greater good.

Kouichi Haimawari grew up aspiring to be a hero, but with a mediocre Quirk like ""sliding"" that ties him to the ground, he soon came to the conclusion that he could only ever admire them from below. Despite this, Kouichi finds contentment in using his Quirk to carry out day-to-day good deeds, such as returning lost items and helping the elderly cross the street.

However, Kouichi's tame life takes a swing into the turbulent when he is rescued from a back alley brawl by Vigilante, or illegal hero, Knuckleduster. Seeing hero potential in Kouichi, Knuckleduster enlists his help in tracking down the source of a dangerous drug known as Trigger that boosts the user's Quirk at the expense of their rationality.

Set in a time before the events of the original story, Vigilante: Boku no Hero Academia Illegals follows Kouichi as he chooses to don the reputation of a villain and become a Vigilante, operating in the shadow of the law to prevent crimes from taking to the surface.

It is complicated, frustrating, often incomprehensible—and it is something that many high school students are all too familiar with. Love takes on countless forms, but it is an emotion common to different kinds of people: childhood friends, tsunderes, classmates, delinquents, and student council presidents. Love can also flourish between unlikely pairs who bury their feelings deep within them, making it harder and harder to say that one notorious phrase in the human language... ""I love you.""

Tsurezure Children follows the journeys of numerous different couples and their romantic escapades. From the butterflies of a confession to the failed attempts at a first kiss, this story sheds light on the challenges and triumphs of young love.

The discovery propels the professor into the public eye, where he is met with accolades, acclaim, and the rights to name the planet. Deciding to let his daughter Remina serve as the namesake, the shy girl quickly finds herself thrust into an uneasy life of stardom.

Unlike its human counterpart, planet Remina shows nothing but odd behavior. Its movements are unpredictable and show no clear orbital patterns. Even more mysterious, any star it nears soon disappears. The enigma heightens when Professor Ooguro's assistant claims that planet Remina has stopped moving and looked him directly in the eye. Before going mad, the assistant announces one final thing: the planet is now heading toward Earth.

Soon enough, planet Remina enters the solar system, leaving a trail of emptiness and causing worldwide panic. In an instant, popular adoration transforms into hostility; the populace have declared that the Ooguros have orchestrated this disaster and must be destroyed to avert it. Now deemed Public Enemy No. 1, Remina must escape a rabid population, all while the looming threat of the hellstar approaches.

After her passing, Yuuta compiles her life into a movie to screen at his school, deciding to add a bit of fantasy to the ending of his film, Dead Explosion Mother, with a literal explosion!

Following the backlash caused by his supposedly tone-deaf portrayal of his mother's death, Yuuta trudges to the hospital roof to take his own life—but there, he meets a girl named Eri. Captivated by his film, Eri requests Yuuta to make a new  one that will blow the previous out of the water and prove his critics wrong. The movie they set out to make will stand apart by blurring the line between fact and fiction. And of course, it wouldn't be a Yuuta film if it didn't have his personal flavor—just a dash of fantasy.

There is even a weird rumor spreading around in class, claiming that those who successfully spot Shiraishi will be blessed with good fortune for the day.

So far, the only person who notices his existence is Nagisa Kubo, the girl seated next to him. Unfortunately for him though, Kubo likes to tease him on a daily basis and often puts him into unprecedented and nerve-wracking situations. However, as Kubo's playful antics continue to involve the reluctant Shiraishi, he may soon discover that his youth might not be as boring as he initially thought.

As he clutches the guitar in his hands, this melody swirls around and around, screaming words of regret, longing, and loss. But with his careless expression that always seems to be up in the clouds, no one knows his true feelings. However, a chance encounter with classmate Ritsuka Uenoyama may finally give Mafuyu the push to let his voice be heard.

Uenoyama is the guitarist of a band, whose fellow members include the kindhearted bassist Haruki Nakayama and rough-looking drummer Akihiko Kaji. Even without a vocalist, their ragtag group has done well as an instrumental-only band. However, their chance to reach even greater heights may have arrived when Uenoyama hears Mafuyu's voice—Uenoyama is enchanted, inviting the reluctant Mafuyu to join.

Working in a band is a difficult task; often, emotions threaten to break it apart, but they can also bring its members closer together. With Uenoyama's help, Mafuyu may finally be able to express the feelings that fight to break free from within his heart.

His savior, a motorcycle-riding dance instructor, proceeds to drag Tatara to Ogasawara Dance Studio, mistakenly believing that the boy was looking at the studio's flyer.

Their mission: to destroy the ominous evils that lurk in the darkness known as ""Akuma."" Led by the Milenium Earl, Akuma seek to destroy fragments of ""Innocence,"" the only weapons capable of harming the Earl and his army and bring about the Great Flood from a hundred years ago. 

To prevent this tragedy from happening, the Black Order was formed as an organization dedicated to fighting the Earl. They recruit Exorcists, those with the inherent ability to accomodate Innocence, to fight against the Akuma.

In the late 19th century, Allen Walker—a white-haired boy armed with Innocence that takes the form of his entire left arm and a cursed eye that can see Akuma—is sent to the Black Order. There, Allen meets various comrades from the Order—the mercurial Yuu Kanda, the kindhearted Lenalee Lee, and the cheerful yet mysterious Lavi. Despite their different personalities, they have one goal in mind: to bring salvation to the souls of Akuma and prevent the Earl from destroying the world.

Having a leaf imprinted onto his hand by code, Kazuhiko is entrusted with a secret task to deliver a ""package""—a girl with white hair and evergreen eyes whom he finds singing in a birdcage-like building. All Kazuhiko knows is that her name is Suu, and for whatever reason, she wishes to go to Fairy Park.

As his friends Lan and Gingetsu help set up a transport module for the duo, Kazuhiko suspects that there is more to Suu than he knows. Not only is their transport intercepted, but the two are also pursued by Bols—a face that is uncomfortably familiar to Kazuhiko and who seems to have received his own mission to seek out Suu. The truth behind the discreet nature of this operation, Suu's existence, and even a possible connection between her and Kazuhiko may all be linked to just one word: clover.

However, unlike other schools, students at Hyakkaou do not pride themselves on academic achievement. Instead, they value strategic prowess and the ability to read people. Come nightfall, many places on campus transform into gambling dens overseen by the student council, where players compete for rank, money, and more.

Ryouta Suzui spends his days as a ""house pet""—a student ranked in the bottom one hundred, forced to serve his peers. His circumstances soon change when a mysterious new transfer student, Yumeko Jabami, arrives at the academy. Despite Suzui's warnings, Yumeko quickly becomes immersed in the school's gambling scene, facing off against several high-profile opponents.

James Block is a young black man with sinister intentions. When he is in prison, a strange old man tells him about the ""F"" laser beam that makes humans and any other living things invisible. After he has been released from prison, James receives the F laser beam. But because the beam is imperfect, he becomes semitransparent with an ugly figure. From that time on, he calls himself ""Alabaster"" and hates anything beautiful.

Using the F laser beam, he begins to eliminate hypocrites and those who boast of their beauty. When living things are exposed to the F laser beam long enough to become transparent, they die. Meanwhile, Dr. F, who told Alabaster the secret of the F laser beam, had previously used his daughter as a guinea pig to investigate its effects. The daughter, who was pregnant at the time, gave birth to a girl. The girl, who was named Ami, is completely invisible. Alabaster approaches Ami and begins to use her for his dark purposes.

Afraid and alone, he created the Book of Vanitas, a cursed grimoire that would one day take his vengeance on all vampires; this is how the story goes, at least.

Vanitas no Karte follows Noé Archiviste, a young man who is traveling aboard an airship in 19th-century Paris with one goal in mind: to find the Book of Vanitas. A sudden vampire attack leads him to meet the enigmatic Vanitas, a doctor who specializes in vampires and, much to Noé's surprise, an entirely ordinary human. The mysterious doctor has inherited both the name and the infamous text from the Vanitas of legend, using the grimoire to heal his patients. But behind his kind demeanor lies something a bit more sinister.

While younger girls enjoy their love lives, Rinko and her friends—Kaori Yamakawa and Koyuki Torii—wonder what went wrong with theirs.

One night, as the three women are drinking at a bar, they come face-to-face with the handsome model, Key, who tells them off for dwelling on ""what if"" scenarios. Drunk and full of spite, Rinko declares that by the time the Tokyo Olympics arrive in six years, she will not be a bachelorette anymore.

Curiously, he has not grown beyond being a kitten, but he possesses a mysterious power—he can hide inside the Louvre's paintings.

One day, she is asked by her teacher to turn over one of her manga slots in the school newspaper to a truant student named Kyomoto. When Kyomoto's manga pops up alongside Fujino's, it receives high praise for its detailed artwork, making Fujino furiously jealous.

Refusing to be beaten by someone who barely attends school, Fujino devotes herself to learning to create manga. As time goes on though, her goal of outshining Kyomoto seems to only get further and further away; and Fujino, now in sixth grade, eventually gives up and quits making manga.

Graduation day arrives, and Fujino is asked to deliver Kyomoto's graduation certificate to her. Through chance, the two end up coming face to face, and their unexpected meeting will end up having consequences far beyond what either of them could ever predict.

As if in response to these impressions of the artist-travelers, eight authors from the Archipelago portray their own Japan, the everyday one, that of modernity and that of legend. After reading this sentient collection of anecdotes and tales woven together from such different views, one desires nothing more than to visit and see for oneself some bit of the land of the Rising Sun.

However, they disappeared during the final stages of their trek, leading to one of mountaineering's greatest mysteries—did the pair ever make it to the summit?

1993, Kathmandu. Japanese photographer Makoto Fukamachi discovers a vintage camera in an antique store, which he believes might have belonged to Mallory. However, the camera falls into the possession of ""Bikha Sanp,"" a burly Japanese man who Fukamachi realizes may very well be Jouji Habu, a legendary Japanese mountaineer who disappeared from the scene several years ago. Unfortunately for Fukamachi however, Bikha Sanp refuses to talk to him and leaves with the camera in tow.

With the trail gone cold, Fukamachi has only one course left to pursue: to delve into Habu's past and see just what may have brought the former climber to Nepal. For the sake of rewriting mountaineering history, Fukamachi begins his investigation, a task that will bring him to the greatest height in the world—the summit of the gods.

Both Jirou and his grandfather are descendants of a long-standing shinobi clan, training in combat to keep the art of battle alive within their family. Jirou's life is thrown into upheaval after rescuing a seemingly normal black cat, Ragou, only to discover that the cat is actually a mononoke—a demonic spirit that has long been at war with mankind. When a hostile mononoke comes looking for Ragou, Jirou uses his shinobi training to jump to the cat's defense, but immediately suffers a mortal wound.

Faced with the decision of whether or not to devour Jirou's fading energy and restore himself to full power, Ragou instead chooses to give his remaining energy to Jirou. Reviving the boy, the transfer also grants him great supernatural powers that complement his own shinobi fighting style. This act is witnessed by Ryousuke Shiba, an officer in the Bureau of Espionage whose job revolves around dispatching aggressive mononoke.

Most believe it to be only a fairy tale, used to scare children who misbehave. Oz Vessalius, the cheerful and mischievous heir of the noble Vessalius family, is one such individual—until, at his coming-of-age ceremony, the mysterious Baskerville Clan arrives and condemns him to the Abyss for a sin he neither committed nor knows anything about. Oz then forms a contract with Alice, a unique Chain who can take on human form, in an attempt to escape from the Abyss.

As Oz struggles to unravel the mysteries behind his sin, the Abyss, and a tragedy from one hundred years ago, he and his companions find themselves confronted by the Baskervilles and ghosts from the past. Meanwhile, his journey back home is plagued by relentless despair.

However, on one particular night, five strangers find their way to this abandoned village tucked away in the mountains.
 
In Yoigoshi-hen—a possible future outcome of Tsumihoroboshi-hen—Mion Sonozaki, a former resident of the village, arrives at Hinamizawa's now-dilapidated Furude Shrine, seeking shelter from the rain. Along the way, she meets Akira Otobe, whose friends have disappeared. As they enter the shrine, they find others already there, also taking shelter. But when a murder takes place among them, suspicions run high, and some begin to suspect Mion herself: after all, Mion died in the Great Hinamizawa Disaster 20 years ago.

Do you think you'll be one of the ones to die? No, of course not. Do you think you'll win the lottery? You'd like to think so, we all would. But Sumida is different. He wants the status quo to remain in every way; live a normal life, get a normal job, have normal kids, never to be anyone fortunate or unfortunate, content in normalcy. Anyone who doesn't agree is foolish, doomed to live their life scraping up a mountain that they can never conquer, fated to die in despair wishing things had been better.

When his mother kicks his father out of the house and onto the streets, he thinks he'll be fine. When his mother leaves him to live with her boyfriend, he makes the best of it. When he realizes that he's no longer average, he strives to make his life worthwhile the only way he knows how. When the demons in the back of his mind speak to him, he tries his best to ignore them.

Inside are several computers, along with a man named Kokopelli who offers the students a chance to play a game: one where they use a gigantic robot to defeat enemies who attack the Earth. The children agree to sign a contract by touching a shield-like object, and Kokopelli transports them to the cockpit of the Zearth—the mecha they are to pilot.

After an enemy mecha rises from the sea, Kokopelli shows them how to mentally control the Zearth, and defeats it. The children are excited by the prospect of defending the Earth, but not everything is as it seems. The Zearth is in fact powered by life energy, and at the end of every battle, the pilots die. After signing their lives away, the children must now use their time left on Earth to defend it.

Believing that Japan has lacked an egoistic striker hungry for goals, Jinpachi initiates the Blue Lock—a prison-like facility where three hundred talented strikers from high schools all over Japan are isolated and pitted against each other. The sole survivor of Blue Lock will earn the right to become the national team's striker, and those who are defeated shall be banned from joining the team forever. 

Selected to join this risky project is Yoichi Isagi, a striker who failed to bring his high school soccer team to the national tournament. After choosing to pass to a teammate who missed instead of scoring on his own, he could not help but wonder if the results would have been different had he been more selfish. Using this golden opportunity given by the Blue Lock Project, Yoichi aims to clear his doubts and chase his ultimate desire—to become the greatest striker in the world and lead Japan to World Cup glory.

Saved by her rash kindness, the occult-obsessed boy attempts to speak to her about supernatural interests he believes they share. Rejecting his claims, Ayase proclaimed that she instead is a believer in ghosts, starting an argument between the two over which is real.

In a bet to determine who is correct, the two decide to separately visit locations associated with both the occult and the supernatural—Ayase visiting the former and the boy visiting the latter. When the two reach their respective places, it turns out that neither was wrong and that both the occult and ghosts do exist.

This marks the beginning of Ayase and the boy's adventure, as they attempt to fix the surreal, supernatural, and occult elements around them to return to a normal life.

Depending on your family's wealth and your individual merit, you can be classified as a Silver or Bronze student. However, there is only one Gold student, and this year that person is Shizumasa Touguu—nicknamed ""the Emperor"" because he is the Student Council President.

When she was very young, Haine Otomiya fell in love with Shizumasa, after reading the children's picture book that he authored. She had met him twice before attending Imperial Academy, but as a Bronze student, her rank is far below his, so she has been unable to approach him at school. 

Haine jumps at an opportunity to get close to Shizumasa, and she unexpectedly becomes his bodyguard as well as a member of the Student Council.

A boy and a girl, raised in an abandoned virology research center, immune to the virus, are attacked by the Propater and escape.

Twenty years later, the boy is the most powerful drug lord in South America. He aids his son from behind the scenes as he evades and eventually with the help of mercenaries from Nomad (some of them former Propater operatives) fights the Propater. As the plot develops focus shifts away from the main character and develops many sub-plots dedicated to terrorism, Human-improvement, the struggle of the developing countries and the power battles between the drug cartels and Propater.

Based strongly on Gnostic mythology, all major characters are named after gnostic deities, and have analogous roles.

An unusual group of friendly people gathers there, each with their own stories to tell.

Tasuku Kaname is a troubled high school student who is prepared to commit suicide because his classmates found out that he might be gay. As he questions his existence, the sight of a mysterious woman jumping off a nearby building leaves him utterly startled. He rushes to the scene only to discover her unharmed, soon learning that she is the owner of the aforementioned building, known to everyone as Anonymous.

Anonymous notices Tasuku's nervous temperament and offers him an ear if he is willing to share his problems. While speaking to her, he realizes that the most painful thing is his inability to accept his sexuality. Emotional and heartfelt, Shimanami Tasogare is a realistic take on the struggles of Tasuku among other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in coming to terms with their selves.

When an injured, lone wolf comes limping by and lays down to die, It takes on the form of the animal. Finally, It gains consciousness and begins to traverse the empty tundra until It meets a boy.

The boy lives alone in a ghost town, which the adults abandoned long ago in search of the paradise said to exist far beyond the endless sea of white tundra. However, their efforts were for naught, and now the boy is in a critical state.

Acquiring the form of the boy, It sets off on a never-ending journey, in search of new experiences, places, and people.

Having joined the high school badminton team, Taiki tries to attend open practice as early as possible. But no matter how early he goes, he always arrives second in the gymnasium. The person one step ahead of him is Chinatsu Kano, a first-year student in senior high and Taiki's crush.

Chinatsu is the rising star of the basketball team, and the gap between her and Taiki could not be greater. Although Taiki is a decent badminton player, his popularity is nowhere near Chinatsu's, making it even less likely for his feelings to be reciprocated. However, in a strange twist of fate, she ends up living in Taiki's house!

Wanting to become a worthy match for Chinatsu, Taiki pursues the same dream as his crush: to partake in the Nationals. Taiki starts training harder than ever before, all for the sake of building a strong relationship with his new housemate.

One day, a girl with a scar on her forehead named Kouko Ishigami, accompanied by a ghost of a tall and friendly man, transfers into his class.

Fuuta quickly takes a liking to Kouko, wondering if it might be love at first sight. After waking up crying from a strange dream involving her, he feels a nostalgic connection to Kouko and becomes determined to befriend her. However, a chain of events forces Fuuta to reveal his birthmark to Kouko, to which she declares him to be the enemy of her life. A furious Kouko explains that the two are bound by reincarnation, and that Fuuta's birthmark is a curse she engraved on him in one of their past lives to recognize and eventually defeat him.
 
Kouko brings out a circular object made of flames known as the ""spirit circle"" and attacks Fuuta, pushing him off a flight of stairs. As he falls, Fuuta is thrown back into the insight of one of his previous lives. Spirit Circle chronicles Fuuta's journey back and forth his several past lives as he gradually unravels the mysteries behind his apparent bad blood with Kouko.

Although all his actions belie good intentions, he is unable to find work in most towns. One day, idle and bored, he meets Karu—a strange boy who falls from the sky and lands on top of him.

Karu tells Manji to be wary of Toys, a type of doll that moves autonomously. When the two come under attack, Karu is surprised by both Manji's skill in cutting down Toys with a katana and his reckless disregard for his own life. Manji is seriously injured after the fight, but Karu exhibits an ability to transfer the wounds to himself—forming a pact between the two. 

As Karu's pact holder, Manji receives a tentative welcome into the organization called Cards. Its ultimate goal is to find Alice, the Toy-making factory from which the insane inventor AAA unleashes his murderous creations upon the world. What shocking secrets will Manji uncover as he joins Cards in the battle against AAA?

Serving as the ferrymen are the famous Kumou brothers: the eccentric family head, Tenka; the reckless but noble second son, Soramaru; and the guileless youngest, Chuutarou. In spite of their grim work, the three lead relatively peaceful lives in the ever-cloudy town of Oumi, together with their housekeeper, Shirasu Kinjou.

But buried in the long history of Oumi is the legend of the terrifying Orochi, a serpentine beast that awakens every three hundred years in a human vessel. Unbeknownst to Soramaru and Chuutarou, the actual job of the Kumou family is to seal the Orochi away before it fully revives—or the world will be plunged into destruction. Amid the monster's next resurrection, the Kumou family must find the resolve to keep laughing under the clouds.

Still, she manages to retain her curious and pragmatic spirit, planning to work until her years of servitude are over. One day, however, she catches wind of the fact that the emperor's two infants have fallen gravely ill.

Maomao soon finds herself in the emperor's inner court, where she gradually makes a name for herself by utilizing her knowledge and eccentric personality to solve various medical mysteries.

Their interactions are brief, limited to Suzuki's unprompted random questions and Tani's succinct answers. Yet, beneath these simple exchanges, feelings of love are quietly blossoming.

Suzuki sees Tani for who he is: a straightforward boy who respects everyone equally, completely unconcerned about fitting in. Unlike Tani, she is too hung up on what everyone else thinks, desperate to keep her crush a secret. However, a slight misunderstanding leads to Suzuki confessing her feelings—and to her delight, Tani feels the same. Jittery with excitement, the young couple starts dating, embarking on a wonderful journey of friendship and love.

Thus she joins the reluctant Kyouma on his duties, and together they begin solving the mysteries that lie behind the illegal modified Coils.

Guilds are spurred on by this promise, traversing the labyrinthine dungeon in search of the magician. Laios Touden, the leader of one such guild, encounters a dragon that wipes out his party and devours his sister, Falin. Despite having lost the entirety of their supplies and belongings, Laios along with Marcille Donato, an elven healer, and Chilchuck Tims, a halfling thief, immediately reenter the dungeon, determined to save Falin.

Time being of the essence, Laios suggests the taboo of eating the monsters of the dungeon as a means of gathering supplies. Upon the preparation of their first meal in the dungeon, they are stopped by an on-looking dwarf named Senshi. An enthusiast of monster cooking, he helps them prepare their monster ingredients for safe consumption. After learning of Laios' circumstances, Senshi expresses his desire to cook a dragon and joins their guild, thus beginning their food-filled foray into the dungeon together.

Getter Robo pioneered the idea of the combining and transforming robot.

Millions of years ago, the dinosaurs were driven deep underground due to the sudden arrival of ""Getter Rays"" on Earth. After evolving into sentient beings, they grew bitter and vengeful at the humans who replaced them on the surface and began plotting their attack on humanity.

Fighting against them is Getter Robo, a machine built by Professor Saotome which uses the mysterious Getter Rays as its power source. Piloting it are three strong-willed young men—the violent martial artist Nagare Ryoma, the psychopathic yet highly intelligent revolutionary Jin Hayato, and the hot-blooded judo master Tomoe Musashi. Each controls one of three specially designed combat jets which can be combined together in different forms to form three different kinds of giant robots: the flying, axe-wielding Getter-1, the quick,

His rambunctiousness and general lack of concern for others around him tends to get him into trouble, often having to rely on his older brother Tadashi to bail him out.

At a showcase hosted by the Sans Fransokyo Institute of Technology, Hiro exhibits his microbots capable of gathering together and transforming into all kinds of large figures. He is also introduced to Baymax at the event, which is Tadashi's entry that can automatically diagnose and treat humans in need of medical assistance. Little did the young genius know that this rotund robot would soon become the last connection to the only person he truly cared about.

So naturally, in the summer of 2006 when the Nanba brothers witness something strange in the night sky, Hibito declared that he would become an astronaut and travel to the Moon, while Mutta countered with the affirmation that he would go to Mars. That was the promise they made to each other.

Now in 2025, while Hibito is working with NASA and preparing to become the first Japanese to land on the moon, Mutta has been fired from his job in an automotive development company. Having difficulty finding another job, Mutta is given a lifetime opportunity when he receives a letter from JAXA—the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency—telling him that he has been accepted to participate in the next astronaut selection. As if fate has given him a chance to fulfill the promise he made all those years ago, Mutta undertakes the difficult challenge of going to space.

But to his dismay, like his deceased grandmother, Reiko, he possesses the ability to see ""youkai,"" or spirits. Natsume eventually discovers that Reiko had bequeathed to him a book of contracts in which she had bound youkai—the ""Book of Friends."" However, without Reiko ever calling upon the spirits' names, they have been left in a confined state. Now, these spirits continuously pursue Natsume in the hopes of having their contracts dissolved for freedom.

While there may be gentle, harmless spirits which come to Natsume for help, there are also malicious, hostile spirits that threaten him. This is where Madara steps in, a spirit disguised as a rotund cat. Commonly referred to as Nyanko-sensei by Natsume, Madara is a self-proclaimed bodyguard who has his own motives for accompanying Natsume.

Natsume Yuujinchou is a supernatural slice-of-life series about a boy who struggles to live a normal life while balancing the spirit and human worlds and acquiring important life lessons along the way.

He has been called ""the grandfather of Japanese alternative comics"" and has influenced generations of cartoonists around the world. Now the visionary creator of ""The Push Man and Other Stories"" and ""Good-bye"" has turned his incisive, unflinching gaze upon himself. Over ten years in the making, ""A Drifting Life"" is Tatsumis' most ambitious, personal, and heart felt work: an autobiographical bildungsroman in comics form. Using his life long obsession with comics as a frame work, Tatsumi weaves a complex story that encompasses family dynamics, Japanese culture and history, first love, the intricacies of the manga industry, and most importantly, what it means to be an artist. Alternately humorous, enlightening, and haunting, this is the masterful summartion of a fascinating life and a historic career.

While not as outright threatening as some of the larger nightmares out there, goblins are capable of grotesque feats of brutality in their own rights, often joining together in large bands and spreading destruction.

Enter the justly titled Goblin Slayer, whose sole mission in life is to wreak havoc on goblins, murdering as many of them as he possibly can. Utilizing the realm's reigning mission system for adventurers, Goblin Slayer makes sure to accept any and all goblin-related missions.

One of these quests brings him into contact with a young Priestess, who he rescues from an assault at the hands of a particularly nasty group of goblins who have raped and slaughtered her entire party. Although initially averse to human connection, Goblin Slayer begrudgingly finds himself developing an attachment to Priestess and the other party members that they gain along the way. Often tugged into massive adventures that pull him away from his goblin-murdering comfort zone, Goblin Slayer works to keep his party safe from harm and gradually overcomes the childhood trauma that crafted him into the killing machine he has become.

This comes at the cost of neglecting his family, causing his wife to file for divorce. Similarly, Natsumi Okajima, a mother of two girls, has had enough of her husband's adulterous behavior and leaves him. 

Taking their children, both Shoutarou and Natsumi buy new houses to have a fresh start to their lives. However, they are conned by the same person in an elaborate real estate scam, resulting in the pair purchasing the same house!

In other words, she is a closet otaku and more specifically, a fujoshi. After a breakup due to these kind of interests, she quits her job and joins a new company. At her new workplace, the only colleagues who know about her secret are her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji, a blunt gaming otaku; Hanako Koyanagi, a cool and mature-looking beauty; and Tarou Kabakura, an attractive guy with a scary face who always gets into fights with Hanako.

While having drinks to catch up, Hirotaka advises Narumi to date someone who would understand her hobbies. But she is hesitant—otakus are typically perceived as gross, and the only ones who can understand them are otakus themselves. Or could a relationship between two otakus work?

Following the relationship of Narumi and Hirotaka as they begin dating, Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a light-hearted story about those who try to balance work, relationships, and hobbies.

He moved to Tokyo where he was assistant to Rentaro Itai and debuted in manga in 1969. Throughout the 70´s and 80´s he produced a large body of work in many genres including the comedies FUTARI TO GONIN (Two People and Five) and YAKEKUSO TENSHI (Desperate Angel), the Science Fiction Seiun (Japanese Hugo) Award winning FUJOURI NIKKI (Absurd Diary) and is also known as the father of Lolicon manga. But the pressures told and, in 1989, he ran away from his responsibilities and went homeless. After this experience and his eventual return to normal life, he then repeated the cycle in 1992, this time becoming a gas pipe layer in another town. Later, in 1998, his alcoholism was so bad that he was forced into rehab. This book is his expression of those three periods of his life told, not in a deep or depressed way but, as befits his nature, in a buoyant and cheerful cartoon art and is a welcome addition to the ""personal manga"" genre. In 2005, SHISSOU NIKKI (Disappearance Diary) was awarded the Grand Prize from the 9th Japan Media Arts Festival Manga Division and the Excellence Price at the 34th Japan Cartoonists Association Awards.

Most believe it to be only a fairy tale, used to scare children who misbehave. Oz Vessalius, the cheerful and mischievous heir of the noble Vessalius family, is one such individual—until, at his coming-of-age ceremony, the mysterious Baskerville Clan arrives and condemns him to the Abyss for a sin he neither committed nor knows anything about. Oz then forms a contract with Alice, a unique Chain who can take on human form, in an attempt to escape from the Abyss.

As Oz struggles to unravel the mysteries behind his sin, the Abyss, and a tragedy from one hundred years ago, he and his companions find themselves confronted by the Baskervilles and ghosts from the past. Meanwhile, his journey back home is plagued by relentless despair.

After attracting many admirers back in middle school which resulted in her being shunned by her female classmates, she decided that high school will be her chance to revamp her image. Therefore, she starts acting unfeminine and indifferent to boys, allowing her to make some ""friends"" along the way. 

Little does Futaba know, her life will take another drastic turn when her first love, Kou Mabuchi, returns after his sudden disappearance years ago in middle school. Despite his extended absence, the fond memories they shared together still linger in her mind, and she wishes to return to those days. But she realizes that the sweet, gentle boy of the past has completely vanished, and in his place stands someone cold and pessimistic. While he admits that her feelings for him back then were mutual, he warns that they can never go back to the past, as everything, including him, has changed. 

Ao Haru Ride follows Futaba as she searches for true love and friendship, all while trying her best to stay true to herself.

Ten years have passed since that fateful day, leaving Raku's memory of her faded. But he still holds a relic of their relationship together—a locked pendant, which his childhood friend holds the key to. He hopes to reunite with her one day, despite not remembering what she looks like.

Now a first-year student at Bonyari High School, Raku attempts to live a normal life, dreaming of becoming a public servant and marrying his crush Kosaki Onodera. However, this isn't as easy as it seems, as he is the unwilling heir to a large yakuza family, and Raku can't escape from his duties when the American Bee Hive gang wages war on his family's turf. In order to forge peace between the two feuding families, Raku is forced into a fake romantic relationship with Chitoge Kirisaki, the beautiful daughter of the Bee Hive's leader. The two quickly come to hate each other, but have to learn to live together and pretend to be deeply in love in order to keep their families at bay. 

However, Raku's quest for the key to his pendant isn't becoming easier as more girls—who were all involved with his pendant in some way—enter his life. Join Raku as he juggles his false relationship, maintains the balance between warring families, and unravels the identity of the girl who will unlock his heart.

Having been raised in an orphanage, this mansion is the only thing left of her real family, so Himari pays no mind to the rumors that it may be haunted. Upon entering it, she meets Aoi Nanamori and his companions, Ise and Yukari, who all seem to be squatting in her new home. Although they warn her to leave the house, Himari vows to be the one to make them leave instead.

But soon, she is attacked by youkai and finds out that the house sits in the space between the world of the living and the spirit realm. Even more surprising, Aoi was chosen to be the guardian of the house—a position originally meant for Himari. But this great power came with an awful price: Aoi can never leave the mansion, and his existence in the human world has been erased. Ignoring his pleas for her to leave the mansion, Himari promises to help Aoi break the housebound curse as she begins living under the same roof as him.

In the end, Tenma decides to gamble his reputation by saving Johan, effectively leaving the mayor for dead.

As a consequence of his actions, hospital director Heinemann strips Tenma of his position, and Heinemann's daughter Eva breaks off their engagement. Disgraced and shunned by his colleagues, Tenma loses all hope of a successful career—that is, until the mysterious killing of Heinemann gives him another chance.

Nine years later, Tenma is the head of the surgical department and close to becoming the director himself. Although all seems well for him at first, he soon becomes entangled in a chain of gruesome murders that have taken place throughout Germany. The culprit is a monster—the same one that Tenma saved on that fateful day nine years ago.
